(1, 1, 'Andrew P. 的见证', '<p>Andrew P. 的见证</p>\n<p>（以下是前芝加哥UBF宣教士安德鲁所做的报告，该文于2000年发表在ubfnet.com网站上。）</p>\n<p>过了些年。。。</p>\n<p>首先我要讲的是一名年轻人自杀的事件。我相信，在一定程度上你也听说过这起案件。不同的是，我是亲眼所见、亲耳所闻地经历了芝加哥UBF（撒母耳•李）是如何处理这起事件的全部过程。让我再跟你重复一遍，我将见证的是我亲眼所见、亲耳所闻的事，信不信取决于你自己。当撒母耳•崔前来芝加哥时，我曾因一些计算机相关的事和他有过几面之缘。这是因为那段时间里我负责芝加哥UBF里有关计算机的工作。当时，他看上去依然是个年纪轻轻、天真烂漫的优等生。撒母耳•李把他分配在乔舒亚•洪的团契里面，当时这个团契的学生工作是做得最有成效的一个。乔舒亚•洪是一位非常忠实的神的仆人，对神充满热情。实际上，我后来听说的故事是这样的：约瑟夫•金在韩国曾协助过撒母耳•崔，他是崔允淑的羊羔。由于约瑟夫•金对撒母耳•崔相当了解，因此想要与他同住，以便继续帮助他。然而，在芝加哥UBF的氛围底下，这种事是不可能说出来的。只要撒母耳•李作出了指示，即使不合理，也只得乖乖服从，没有任何回旋余地。即使到了今天，我依然能够清楚记得约瑟夫•金是如何悔恨自己没有能给撒母耳•崔帮上忙，令他最终选择了自杀的情景。</p>\n<p>记忆中，撒母耳•崔先是参加了一个语言培训班，随后进入了伊利诺伊州大学（位于芝加哥）念书。不幸的是，正如我的经历一样，在美国大学里念书，对于英语本来就很差劲的韩国学生来说，要赶上学科的进度并不是件容易的事。撒母耳•崔拼命地挣扎着，像是深受了打击。乔舒亚•洪想帮助他依靠信仰来得胜，但是撒母耳•崔早已无能为力。他退修了全部的课程。后来，我不晓得是撒母耳•李，还是他自己个人的意思，他转学去了罗耀拉大学[1]。可即便转去了那里，他仍无法很好地应付学业。他渴望回到韩国。我记得乔舒亚•洪对我说过，这还是他第一次见到如此软弱的人。我从约瑟夫•金那儿听说，此前他在韩国已经有过一次自杀的尝试，于是他的母亲叫他返回韩国，免得因为遇到挫折就轻易放弃生命。最后，连乔舒亚•洪也觉得最好的办法就是把他派回韩国为妙。于是，他向撒母耳•李提了建议。就我所知，还有一位宣教士也找过撒母耳•李，给了同样的建议。但是，撒母耳•李却毫不理会，甚至还把崔的护照藏了起来。他还派撒母耳•崔每天打扫center周围那无数的落叶，用这种方式对他进行训练。一天，我下班回家的路上，见到了撒母耳•崔在黄昏时分扫落叶的孤独身影。那些日子里，乔舒亚•洪正在韩国参加他妹妹与他的美国羊羔两人的婚礼。后来，我从一名宣教士口中听说了这样的事：就在撒母耳•崔自杀前两天，她见到过崔。那时，他脸色暗淡，嘴里喃喃着：“有人偷走了我的文件（护照）！”</p>\n<p>他的自杀事件以及随后发生的事</p>\n<p>一个周六下午，我去芝加哥center和我的羊羔一起进行1对1的圣经学习。他的名字叫约瑟夫•克鲁兹，那时，他和撒母耳•崔住在一块儿。他来的时候，我能注意到他的脸上流露出严肃的神情。我问道：“最近好吗？”他回答说不太好。接着他告诉我撒母耳•崔跳楼自杀了。刚开始，我无法相信他所说的。但是他重复了一遍，那个周六的下午，一名警官过来告诉了他撒母耳•崔自杀的消息。这名警官还说，那周的早些时候他也尝试过自杀，但由于他没有告诉他们他的住址，于是他们只好差他回去。于是，我把这则消息告诉了当时待在芝加哥的马克•扬。马克叫我别去告诉任何人（甚至他的父母），让我等候撒母耳•李作出指示。我觉得有必要在芝加哥UBF召开一次紧急的祷告会。可是，那一天芝加哥UBF却非常得安静。我期盼在接下来的主日那天，会发布一些公告。然而，几乎所有的宣教士都只是忙碌着带领自己的羊羔来参加主日礼拜。更糟的是，即使在主日礼拜的公告时间中，撒母耳•李也一点都没有提及到那起事件。主日礼拜刚刚结束之后，当我从约瑟夫•钟（他的儿子娶了撒母耳•崔的姐姐）边上经过时，不经意地听见他在电话里的谈话。他正在电话里要求把遗体尽快（第二天）火化掉，还说没必要举办一场丧礼。保罗•钟在我经过时叫住了我，让我带一批年轻的宣教士到撒母耳•崔的公寓，把他的东西统统扔掉。看着这些事情进展地如此迅速，我一下子震惊地说不出话来。我心里纳闷，怎么一个年轻的生命以及他所拥有的一切居然可以这样得转眼即逝，同时，我也满腔怒火。但我只能服从指示，没得选择。那一周，按例举办了一场助理团契领导人要参加的周二见证分享会，约有二十多人参加了。可是除了仅有的一或两个和我一起的人之外，几乎没有人提起了撒母耳•崔。那次聚会的带领人罗恩•沃德也一点儿没有提到那事，甚至都没有为他和他的父母提出任何代祷的主题。芝加哥UBF没有受到一丝打击，我从未见过哪个人为了那事流过眼泪。我忍不住怀疑这是否真的还是一个基督教团契，我不禁扪心自问，既然我们没有能力用神的爱哪怕帮助一个灵魂，为什么还要把羊羔不停地带进团契当中。我无法确切地记得究竟是在那一周还是在那之后的一周，总之撒母耳•李还是在周五聚会（meeting）的公告时间（announcement time）提到了撒母耳•崔。但是他没有表示对他和他父母的同情或歉意。除了责备了他有钱的父母竟把他抚养成一个如此软弱的人之外，撒母耳•李别的什么都没提。芝加哥UBF里，撒母耳•崔的自杀一案，此后便渐渐被人淡忘。</p>\n<p>杰基•李家庭的破裂</p>\n<p>不知你了解与否，自从芝加哥UBF的初创时期起，直到最近几年前，杰基•李一直都担任撒母耳•李的秘书。她的丈夫雅各•李几年之前死于高血压。几年以前，撒母耳•李免去了她秘书的工作，且当众责备她虽然有接近他的特权，却一点儿没有学习到耶稣的榜样。我清楚杰基有过一段很艰苦的日子，突然之间，她既丢了工作，又失去了丈夫。后来，我得到了一个机会和她谈话。那天，杰基坦言，对神的话语的渴慕使她很难再忍受下去，UBF里讲的神的话语再也不能使她感到满足。于是杰基开始与一间教堂的牧师的妻子一起学习圣经，随后她下了决心，要离开曾投入了全部生命的UBF。那些日子里，杰基住在韩国，撒母耳•李也察觉到她要离开UBF的迹象。杰基有五个女儿和一个儿子，其中三个女儿已经在UBF里嫁了人。她的女儿和我在一个团契里面，因此我得以从头了解到整个事件的全部过程。先是撒母耳•李突然让当时正住在杰基•李家中的她最年长的女儿和女婿搬进UIC Bible House旁边居住，然后他让杰基•李还未嫁人的四女儿也搬去那里。但是最小的女儿和最小的儿子则跑去了韩国她们母亲那里。撒母耳•李匆忙派杰基•李的四女儿（当时年仅19岁左右）前去韩国，要求她立即提交和一名韩国牧者（我听说他要比她年长6-7岁左右）的结婚申请书。</p>\n<p>当杰基回到芝加哥后，她与其女儿和女婿有过许多争执。后来我从她年纪最小的女儿（一位高中生）那里打听到撒母耳•李曾去找过杰基，对她说，她没有资格瞻仰他父亲的坟墓。她顿时哑然，问他为什么不能瞻仰父亲的坟墓。撒母耳•李解释说，是因为她羞辱了她父亲的名声。他还说，自从她离开了UBF，就变得骄傲起来，而且转而攻击神的仆人。他还诅咒她。正因如此，她最小的女儿受到了巨大的创伤。一天，杰基接到了来自那四个已婚女儿的来电，她们一个接一个地和她们的妈妈交谈。她们让她别去看望她们，也别给她们打电话。据那位最小的女儿猜测，好像是某人（她认为是撒母耳•李）一面在背后作指示，一面让她们在电话里复述他的话。连她的女婿也给杰基•李打了电话，声称不会与她见面，其中一名女婿甚至称呼他的岳母为撒旦。杰基又动身去了趟韩国。到了韩国，尽管她对他们的婚姻并不感到满意，她还是尝试去见那位娶了她四女儿的女婿及他们的家长。然而撒母耳•李（据杰基•李 的说法）早已给他们打了电话，说她加入了文鲜明（译注：统一教教主）的组织，指示他们不要见她。于是娶了四女儿的那名女婿没有去见她，还待她好像敌人一般。但是他的父母后来说服了他，让他待岳母的态度好一点，别比待世俗的人还差，这样彼此还能够见面，虽然如此，他们还是对她充满着敌意。</p>\n<p>最终，在撒母耳•李生日那一周的周五，举办了十对夫妇的结婚典礼，杰基•李的四女儿的婚礼就在其中。可是那位女儿却打电话给杰基•李让她不要参加。杰基在经过漫长的祷告后硬是参加了这场结婚仪式。你也许能猜想得出，一旦你离开了UBF，他们会对你有多大的敌意。因此杰基决心参加女儿的结婚典礼，这对她来说是一个艰难的决定。这十对参加婚礼的新人当中，新娘们都是20刚出头的传教士们的女儿，新郎们则都是年轻的韩国传教士。那时，我虽然已经离开了UBF，还是听说到他们在短短15分钟内就结束了整场婚礼的消息。据说撒母耳•李打电话给杰基•李，说因为他给她女儿的婚姻作了祝福，因此她得至少奉献20,000美金。</p>\n<p>别再有更多人成为撒母耳•李帝国的受害者！</p>\n<p>实际上，我还有很多的事可以分享，但我已经列举了两起基于事实经历的惊人事件。我亲眼见到，他们麻木地看待一个年轻生命的死去，我还亲眼见到，一个家庭受到了拆散。我意识到有些东西错了。我无法理解母亲和亲生女儿之间是怎么会成为仇敌的。我无法理解女婿怎么会将她的岳母称作撒旦的。芝加哥UBF里没有一人敢说出事实真相，我为此哀叹，但我也曾是其中之一。那是因为说出了事实，你就无法继续留在芝加哥UBF。所以最终，我的家庭就像这样离开了芝加哥UBF。因此我也能像这样写下见证，为了说出哪怕一点点的真相。</p>\n<p>我渴望的是：请让人们了解芝加哥UBF的真实写照。请试着做出努力，好使得那些年轻传教士们不被撒母耳•李帝国所害，就像我一样，不知情中，朦胧迈进了芝加哥UBF。脱离芝加哥UBF无法避免地，许多人仍然深处痛苦，心灵受到创伤。请为他们祷告。</p>\n', 'Testimony of Andrew P. <br />(The following was reported by Andrew P., a former Chicago UBF missionary, and published in the year 2000 on the ubfnet.com web site.) <br /><br />Some years already have passed after I came to Chicago as a student lay missionary. But now, I am asking God for my future guidance, leaving UBF inevitably with a painful heart and deep agony where I devoted my youth and time. In fact, I tried to postpone writing this kind of report. Considering my immature inner being in my staying in UBF, I thought it was the most urgent thing for me to have the personal relationship with God newly and to grow spiritually, instead of doing something right now. However I am writing like this due to my conscience of faith that I should let them know the facts before too late, while I am reading the articles of the web site ubfnet.com. I pray I may not be emotional and write only the facts truthfully in the sight of God. Frankly speaking, I did not have any personal conflict with M. Samuel Lee. When I first came to Chicago UBF, I regarded him so highly and even had a fear to some degree. Yet, from the time I can not exactly remember particularly, I started to listen to the Christian radio and cassette tapes, especially after I finished my school study and went to work in a company in order to solve my visa problem. Then I developed the insight to see Chicago UBF objectively. There are lots of things about which I can speak out. But right now, I want to share with you just two big events which made me leave Chicago UBF. If the opportunities are given, I will share with you more details. <br /><br />First, the suicide of a young man. I believe that you also know this case to some extent. But I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears how Chicago UBF (M. Samuel Lee) dealt with this case. I am telling you once again, I will witness what I saw with my eyes and heard with my ears. The judgment is all up to you. When Samuel Choi came to Chicago, I met him several times because of computer related business. That''s because I served the computer-related things in those days in Chicago UBF. At that time, he seemed to be a still young, naive and good student. M. Samuel Lee put him in the fellowship of M. Joshua Hong which had the most fruitful student work in those days. M. Joshua Hong is a very faithful servant of God who had the enthusiasm toward God. Actually, the story I heard later is like this: M. Joseph King was the sheep of S. Yoonsook Choi, and he helped Samuel Choi in Korea. Since M. Joseph King knew Samuel Choi well, he wanted to live with him and help him. But under the atmosphere of Chicago UBF, it was impossible to bring out this kind of matter. Once M. Samuel Lee gives the direction, there is no other way except obeying him, even though his direction is unreasonable. Even now I can remember vividly that later on M. Joseph King lamented over how he could not help Samuel Choi and eventually he committed a suicide. <br /><br />As I recall, Samuel Choi attended a language course first. Then he enrolled in the University of Illinois (at Chicago). But, as I also have the similar experience, it was not easy for the Korean student who did not have the good English skill to catch up the academic course of university in USA. It seems that Samuel Choi was frustrated by himself, struggling desperately. M. Joshua Hong tried to help him to overcome by faith, but Samuel Choi already could not handle it. He dropped all his courses. I don''t know whether it was the direction of M. Samuel Lee or his own personal direction, but he transferred to Loyola University. But he could not carry out his studies well even there. He wanted to go back to Korea. I remember M. Joshua Hong telling me that it was the first time he had seen such a weak person. It is what I heard from M. Joseph King that he already had tried to commit suicide once in Korea, and his mother had asked him to return to Korea without committing a suicide in his difficulties. Eventually, M. Joshua Hong also judged it better to send him back to Korea. He visited M. Samuel Lee and suggested about that matter. In my knowledge, another missionary also visited M. Samuel Lee and gave the same proposal. But M. Samuel Lee had his passport taken away, ignoring their advice. And he gave training to Samuel Choi. He put him in charge of sweeping the countless fallen leaves around the center everyday. I also saw Samuel Choi''s lonely appearance, sweeping the fallen leaves in the late afternoon, when I came from work. In those days, M. Joshua Hong was in Korea because of the marriage of his sister with his American sheep. Later, I heard from one missionary like this: she saw Samuel Choi just two days before his suicide. At that time, he had no focus in his eyes, mumbling, &quot;Somebody stole my document (passport)!&quot; <br /><br />His Suicide and Afterwards <br /><br />It was a Saturday afternoon. I went to the Chicago center to study the 1:1 Bible study with my sheep. His name is Joseph Cruz, and he was living a common life with Samuel Choi in those days. When he came, I could read something serious from his face. I asked, &quot;How are you&quot;? He answered that he was not so fine. Then he told me that Samuel Choi committed suicide through throwing himself down from a high building. At first, I could not believe his words. But he repeatedly told me that that Saturday afternoon, a policeman came and informed him of Samuel Choi''s suicide. And that policeman said that he had already tried to commit suicide earlier in that week, but they just sent him back since he did not tell them his address. So, I informed this news to S. Mark Yang who was staying in Chicago at that time. But S. Mark told me not to tell anybody (even to his parents), and let me wait until M. Samuel Lee gave the direction. I felt we needed the emergency prayer meeting in Chicago UBF. Yet, at that day, Chicago UBF was very quiet. I expected there would be some announcement on the next day, the Lord''s day. However, almost all missionaries were very busy to bring their sheep to the Sunday worship service. What was worse, M. Samuel Lee did not mention anything about that event even during the announcement of Sunday worship service. It was just after the Sunday worship service. By accident, I overheard the telephone dialogue of Dr. Joseph Chung (his son married the older sister of Samuel Choi), when I was passing through. He was asking the quick (the next day) cremation of the remains through the telephone. He said it was not necessary to have the funeral service. M. Paul Chung took hold of me when I was passing by, and let me bring young missionaries to Samuel Choi''s apartment and throw away all his belongings. I was struck dumb to see all these things were progressed so quickly. I had a question that the life of one young man and everything that belonged to him could be disappeared like this in futility, and at the same time I came to be filled with anger. But I did not have the choice except obeying that direction. In that week, there was a regular Tuesday testimony sharing meeting for the assistant fellowship leaders. Almost over twenty people were gathered. But almost everybody did not mention anything about Samuel Choi. Only one or two people with me, mentioned about that. S. Ron Ward, who was the leader of that meeting, did not mention it thoroughly either. Even he did not give any prayer topic for his parents and him. Chicago UBF was never shaken at all. I never saw somebody shed his tears because of that matter. I could not but doubt whether or not this was a Christian fellowship. I couldn''t help asking why we needed to keep on bringing sheep, while we could not serve even a single soul with God''s love. I can not remember exactly whether or not it was that week or the next week, but eventually M. Samuel Lee mentioned about Samuel Choi in the announcement time of Friday meeting. But he expressed no compassion toward him or sympathy toward his parents. M. Samuel Lee blamed his rich parents for raising him up to be so weak. That was all. And the suicide case of Samuel Choi came to be forgotten in Chicago UBF. <br /><br />The Destruction of M. Jackie Lee''s Family <br /><br />I don''t know whether you know it or not, but M. Jackie Lee served M. Samuel Lee as a secretary until recently, some years ago, from the pioneering stages of Chicago UBF. Her husband, M. Jacob Lee, died of hypertension some years ago. Some years ago, M. Samuel Lee let her quit the job of the secretary, and publicly blamed her that she did not learn Jesus at all even though she had the privilege to be near him. I know M. Jackie had a very difficult time because suddenly she lost her job and her husband also died. Later on, I had an opportunity to talk with her. At that time, M. Jackie confessed that it was very difficult for her to endure because of the thirst for God''s Word. She said she could not be satisfied any more through God''s Word in UBF. So M. Jackie started to have the Bible study with a wife of the pastor of a church. Then she decided to leave UBF to which she gave all her life. In those days, M. Jackie was staying in Korea. And M. Samuel Lee became aware of the signs of her leaving UBF. M. Jackie has five daughters and a son. Three daughters are already married in UBF. I could see this case from the first, since her daughters were in the same fellowship with me. Suddenly, M. Samuel Lee let the family of her eldest daughter and son-in-law who were living in the house of M. Jackie Lee to move into the house near the UIC Bible House. And he let the fourth daughter of M. Jackie Lee, who was not married yet, move into the same house, too. But the youngest daughter and the youngest son went to Korea with their mother. M. Samuel Lee hurriedly sent the fourth daughter of M. Jackie Lee (about 19 years old at that time) to Korea and let her immediately submit the paper of the marriage with a Korean shepherd (I heard that he was about 6-7 years older than her). <br /><br />When M. Jackie came back to Chicago, she had a lot of conflicts with her daughters and sons-in-law. Later I heard from the youngest daughter (a high school student) that M. Samuel Lee visited M. Jackie. At that time, he said to her that she was not qualified to go to her father''s tomb. She was dumbfounded and asked him back why she could not visit. Then M. Samuel Lee said that she defiled the name of her father. And he said that since she left UBF, she became proud and turned against the servant of God. And he cursed her. Because of this, that youngest daughter was immeasurably hurt. One day, M. Jackie received a call from the four married daughters. They started to talk to their mom one by one. They said to her not to call them and not to visit them. According to the youngest daughter, it seemed that somebody (according to her, M. Samuel Lee) let them copy his words from the back. The sons-in-law also called M. Jackie Lee and declared not to meet her. And one of them even called his mother-in-law Satan. M. Jackie went to Korea again. Even though she did not want that marriage, she tried to meet her fourth son-in-law and his parents, since she was in Korea. But M. Samuel Lee (according to M. Jackie Lee) already called them and gave the direction not to meet her, saying that she was involved in the organization of Sun-Myung Moon. The fourth son-in-law did not try to meet her and treated her like an enemy. But his parents persuaded him not to treat his mother-in-law worse than the worldly people, so that they could meet each other. But it was still hostile. <br /><br />Eventually, there were wedding ceremonies of ten couples on the Friday of the week of the birthday of M. Samuel Lee. Among them, there was the wedding ceremony of the fourth daughter of M. Jackie Lee. But that daughter called to M. Jackie Lee and told her not to come. But M. Jackie attended the wedding ceremony after a long prayer. Maybe, you can guess how much hostile they are, once you left UBF. It was an enormous decision for M. Jackie to attend the wedding ceremony of her daughter. The wedding ceremonies of those ten couples were the marriages between the daughters of the missionaries who were just over twenty and Korean young missionaries. I already left UBF at that time. But I heard that they finished a wedding ceremony in fifteen minutes. I heard that M. Samuel Lee called M. Jackie Lee and demanded that she offer at least $20,000, since he blessed her daughter''s marriage. <br /><br />No More Victims of the Kingdom of Samuel Lee! <br /><br />Actually, I have more things to speak out, but I wrote about two shocking events which I experienced as based on the facts. I realized something was wrong, observing the death of one young man in futility and the separation of one family into two with my own eyes. I could not understand how they became enemies between daughters and their own mother. I could not understand how a son-in-law could call his mother-in-law Satan. I lamented over Chicago UBF where nobody could speak out the truth. But I was one of them. That''s because nobody could stay in Chicago UBF, speaking out the truth. So, eventually, my family left Chicago UBF like this. And I am writing like this, in order to speak out the truth even a little bit. <br /><br />My desire is like this: Please let people know the true picture of Chicago UBF. And please try to make efforts that the young missionaries should not be victimized by the kingdom of Samuel Lee, coming to Chicago UBF without knowing anything about the situation here like me. Leaving Chicago UBF unavoidably, many are still in the deep agony and great pain.

(3, 3, 'parkhjoy的见证？', '<p>教会是信徒团契相交，互相帮助，敬拜事奉上帝的地方；但也可以充满流言诽语、失望及伤痕。到教会去是信上帝的正确态度。但被教会的人伤害很深时，这个教会成为别人不愿再跟随上帝的原因，因为他（她）就会把教会及信徒即“基督徒”看成有害和不受欢迎的。</p><p>过去，我去过许多不同的教会。我是一个新教徒，但我也不介意去天主教会。最近我去的一家教会叫UBF。我最近遇到许多韩国人似乎认为UBF不是一个真正意义上的教会，而是一个基督教组织，信徒在那里得到训练而成为传教士。我想我从未想过UBF的这一方面，但UBF的肢体们确实训练成了优秀的圣经教师/牧者，而且也成为传教士为上帝在国外工作。UBF对我来说也是一家教会，因为我每周日都去那里敬拜上帝。</p><p>我觉得在UBF中有很强的传统性。并非每一家UBF里，但在其中一些，强调不少的传统，如写作，在周五分享见证，一对一圣经学习，授渔（going fishing）（即进入校园邀请学生参加圣经学习或邀请他们去教会聚会/崇拜），如果有人会音乐，我认为自己是的，在乐队为周日崇拜和一些特别的事件准备音乐。我觉得做这些事都是很好的。当他们用正直的灵在上帝面前做的时候，他们会让这人的灵性更加成长。但当肢体关注实际传统而非上帝时，问题就出现了。当他们关注群羊（指学习圣经的学生）的数量，关注他们邀请到有多少人参加敬拜，诸如此类，他们就忘记敬拜上帝的真正含义，忘记遵行神的话语。</p><p>我的确挺赞赏UBF的传教士/牧者，因为他们中许多人努力工作（work ardously）参与到神的救赎工作中。很高兴，我也参加了UBF甚至have一些肢体，能和他们一起学习圣经。但我看到有时UBF中的肢体思想狭隘，不向其它基督徒学习。一些人过于习惯UBF的传统，以至每周忘记为什么不想写见证。其中一些人从未去过其它基督教会，如Navigator航行者和Campus Crusade for Christ校园基督护教会，他们只知道在UBF里是怎么们的情形。</p><p>我个人从没见过李•smauel博士，但我知道他被上帝使用建立UBF，他过去的确为上帝做了巨大的工作，因为UBF已经成了上帝传福音的器皿之一。正是通过UBF的传教士们，我开始认识了基督，所以我很感激UBF。但是当我看到那些认为李•smauel博士是神的仆人的肢体服在他的权柄之下（仅仅因为他是神的仆人），我就奇怪他们是否把上帝放在第一还是在高举一个人。不是我不遵从教会领袖的命令，当然，我应该遵从神的仆人，因为这是正直的灵。但当神的仆人做了错误的事情，当他（她）的言语、行为及思想（并非从神而来，而是来自人的血气）绊倒人们的灵性生活，大家就应该能察觉出这个神的仆人是否真的在做神想让他（她）做的事。这么多人离开UBF一定早有原因。我个人认为那些离开的人不仅仅是因为反对神的仆人。但有些人觉得那些离开UBF的人是对神仆人—李•Samuel博士的反叛心理，他们根本没有跟随耶稣。（我强烈反对这种观点。）如果认为反对李博士的某些行为是错误的，就是那些不是从神来的，而从人的谋算和期望来的行为，对此我觉得还行。但如果他们如果盲目到一种程度根本看不到人的任何错误，我觉得这就是个问题了。</p><p>似乎我非常反对UBF，但我并没有这样试过。我为何要讲UBF的坏话呢？好，我没有说UBF的坏话，而是批评那些有些狭隘观点的人，UBF本身是个好地方，有些人声称想要靠信仰而活，但还使用人的谋算，这似乎引起许多其他人（那些需要灵性帮助的人）转身离开神，离开神的儿女。</p><p>我的一个朋友告诉我说UBF是邪教，他（她）在UBF已经很久了，但显然他（她）的家庭因UBF而受到许多的伤害。我不了解细节，但似乎是和UBF的一个执事有关，因为这是问题出现的通常症结。教会领袖如果不定睛在耶稣身上，他（她）就会像一个导演，由此伤害许多人的心灵。我这朋友对于他（她）很生气，我就告诉他（她）也许不要这样…..他（她）应该释放对UBF的仇恨。。。。但我不得不承认说我没有权利对他说这些事。我从来没有经历过这样的情形，就是被伤害到想到离开UBF。我的家庭不在UBF里，所以我没有经历过整个家庭成了独裁的牺牲品。但我看到UBF的肢体们对于周围的人缺乏牧者的心肠。一些UBF的肢体试图让他们的群羊有负罪感，常常质疑他们“为什么你不能来？”而不是试着去理解他们。询问这事还好，但如果他们不愿了解肢体为什么不能来参加敬拜或周五聚会或是圣经学习，“群羊”怎能告诉他们原因同时又不会觉得有罪？？我的确认为他们甚至不需要问“为什么”，因为他们真的不需要知道其中原因。他们不是相信上帝知道他们的“羊”为何没有参加聚会/圣经学习？如果他们相信，他们也可以只是为“群羊”祷告，这样上帝会感动“群羊”的心来参加敬拜或圣经学习。关心一个人的所有生活内容，是很大的重担。我觉得UBF中的人们想要控制人的生活而不是试着让上帝管理肢体。对“群羊”有期待是对的，但我希望他们不要把自己的想法过多地加在“羊”的身上。他们也许觉得某件事对他们的“羊”是最好的，但有时他们所认为最好的事，不一定对这些“羊”来说是最好的。</p><p>好。我想今天有好多话要讲，上帝知道我的心，我祷告说，当上帝想让我做什么，我总愿意改变自己/自己的态度，这样我更理解更关注而不是更爱批评，心灵更狭隘。上帝会用许多不同的方法工作，如果我的心/思想是紧闭的，我就不能看到上帝在他人生活中的工作。主啊，请给我一颗谦卑的心，主啊，给我力量承担你委托给我的所有事情。谢谢。</p><p>发表于11/23/2003 9:16 AM</p>', '<br />church is a place where people gather together to help each other to worship and serve God. But church can be also a place full of gossip and disappointments and scars. Going to church is a right attitude to have in God. However, when one is hurt so badly because of the people in the church, the church becomes the reason why one doesn''t want to follow God anymore, because he/she sees the church and the people, &quot;Christians,&quot; as harmful and unwelcoming.<br /><br />I have been to many different churches in the past. I am a protetant, but I don''t mind going to catholic services. I am currently going to a church called UBF (University Bible Fellowship). many koreans whom I have met recently seem to think that UBF isn''t a real church, but just a Christian organization where people are trained to become missionaries. I guess I never thought about that aspect of UBF, but it is true that UBF people are trained to become good bible teachers/shepherds, and also to become missionaries who work for God in foreign countries. UBF is also a church to me, because I go there every Sunday to worship God.<br /><br />I feel that there is a strong traiditionism in UBF. Not in every UBF, but in some UBFs many traditions are emphasized like writing and sharing testimonies on Fridays, having one-to-one Bible studies, going fishing (which means you go out to campus to ask students to study the Bible or to ask them to come to one of the church meetings/worship services), and if one is musician, which I consider myself to be one, practicing/playing in an orchestra to prepare music for the Sunday worship services and some special events. I think that all these are very good things to do. When they are done in the right spirit before God, they can allow one to grow more spiritually. But when people become so focused on the actual traidtion and not on God problems arise. When people are concerned with the number of their sheep (refer to bible students), the number of the people they invite to the worship services, and etc., they forget the true meaning of worshipping God and obeying His words.<br /><br />I truly admire UBF missionaries/shepherds because many of them work ardously to participate in God''s salvation work. I am glad that I am involved in UBF and to even have some people whom I can study the Bible with. But I see that some times people in UBF are so close-minded, and they do not learn from other Christians. Some people are so used to UBF traditions that they forget why one wouldn''t want to write testimonies each week. Some people have never gone to other Christian meetings, like the Navigator and Campus Crusade for Christ, and they only know what it is like to be in UBF.<br /><br />I have never met Dr. Samuel Lee personally. But I do know that he was used by God to establish UBF, and he did a great work in God because UBF has become one of God''s instruments to preach the Gospel. It was through UBF missionaries that I have come to know Christ personally, so I am grateful for UBF. However, when I see people who think of Dr. Samuel Lee as God''s servant whom they should ALWAYS obey (just because he is God''s servant), I wonder whether they are putting God first or a human being first. It''s not that I am against obeying church leaders. Of course, I should obey God''s servants, because that''s the right spirit before God. However, when the servant has done something wrong, when the servant has brought down people''s spiritual lives because of his/her own actions/thoughts/words (which do not come from God, but from the human nature), people should be able to discern whether the servant is really doing what God inteded him/her to do. There must have been a reason why so many people left UBF. And I personally don''t think that those people left UBF just to rebel against God''s servants. But some people think that the people who left UBF were being rebellious to God''s servant, Dr. Samuel Lee, and that they weren''t following God. (I strongly disagree with this kind of opinions.) If people think that objecting to Dr. Lee''s certain behaviours, which did not come from God''s own but from human calculations and expectations, is wrong thing to do, that''s okay with me. But if they are so blinded to the extent that they can''t see ANYTHING wrong in a human being, I think that that''s a problem.<br /><br />It seems like I am being so against UBF, but I am not trying to do that. Then why do I say all these bad things about UBF? well, I didn''t say bad things about UBF, but I said some things about the people who seem to be close-minded. UBF is a good place to be, but some people who claim that they want to live by faith and yet have human calculations, seem to cause many others ( who need spiritual help) to turn away from God and from His people.<br /><br />A friend of mine has told me that UBF is a cult. He/she has been in UBF for a long time, but apparently his/her family were hurt a lot because of UBF. I don''t know the details, but it probably has to do with a UBF''s director, because that''s usually where the problem comes from. When a church leader forgets to fix his/her eyes on Jesus, he/she begins to act like a dictator, thus scarring many people''s heart. My friend was mad at him/her when I was telling him/her that maybe he/she shouldn''t generalize so much and that he/she should let go of the hatred which he/she has toward UBF. But I have to admit that I had no right telling him/her things like that. I have never been in a situation where I was so hurt to the extent that I wanted to leave UBF. My family isn''t in UBF, so I haven''t experienced my whole family being the victim of the &quot;dictatorship.&quot; But I see that some people in UBF lack shepherd heart for people around them. Instead of trying to understand, some UBF people tend to make their &quot;sheep&quot; feel guilty by asking them &quot;why can''t you come?&quot; Asking part is okay, but if they do not desire to UNDERSTAND the reason for not coming to worship services or to Friday meetings or to Bible studies, how can the &quot;sheep&quot; actually tell them the reason without feeling guilty?? I actually think that they don''t even have to ask &quot;why&quot; because they do not really need to know the reason. Don''t they believe that God knows why their &quot;sheep&quot; is not coming to the services/bible studies? If they have that faith, they might as well just pray for the &quot;sheep&quot; so that God may move the &quot;sheep&quot;''s hearts to come to the worship services/Bible studies. Trying to know everything about one''s life is sometimes too burndening. I feel like some people in UBF try to dictate one''s life instead of trying to let God control. Having expectations from the &quot;sheep&quot; is okay, but I wish that they didn''t push their own thoughts so much on their &quot;sheep.&quot; They might think that certain things are the best for their &quot;sheep,&quot; but sometimes what they think of the best isn''t always the best for the &quot;sheep.&quot;<br /><br />ok.. I guess I had lot to say today..God knows my heart, and I pray that I may always be willing to change myself/my attitude when God wants me to.. so that I may be more understanding and discerning rather than being more critical and close-minded. God can work in so many different ways, and if my heart/mind is closed, I cannot see the work of God in other people''s lives. Lord, give me a humble heart, and Lord, give me the strength bear all the things you have entrusted to me. thank you!:)<br />Posted 11/23/2003 9:16 AM<br /><br /><br />', 'parkhjoy', '2006年', 'http://afjajiea.com', 1, 1, 1, '2011-08-17 11:42:12');

I really loved the study of Genesis and the Study of John''s Gospel. I made a decision to go to College and serve as a bible teacher to the students. God blessed my life in college and after the summer retreat and making a decision to go to school, a full tuition was in the mail. I was so focused on GOD &amp; JESUS not on man that he protected me and blessed my ministry. I was outspoken during the meetings and believe that created some jealousy even with leaders, but I was walking with Christ and happy. My first 7 years in UBF were blessed years, years of growth and fellowship. I stayed in this ministry for 13 years total; the last 6 were hard and dry due to the fact that I did not follow the beat of the leader''s drum after graduation. It was the only time I had to deal with the leader and the unthoughtful words and actions that came out of his mouth. But like I said before...God Protected me from the garbage and helped me to stay focused on Him. I felt that I was stuck in this place until I started attending another church. I realize how small a view of Christianity I had in UBF. God is SO, SO much bigger and better. Unfortunately, any organization that puts others down, and says they''re the only one and the only way, and if you leave you''re doomed...this is a danger sign and a sign of a cult. UBF began at the Clark Street Center as a nice humble place. There were so many good people with giving hearts in this ministry that wanted to serve God. I have heard many heartbreaking stories of lives crushed by the words and actions of Mr. Lee and his followers. God used me to encourage them to move on. There is Life after UBF. And God will use what we learned there. I dare not call Mr. Lee a Reverend, Pastor or Shepherd. The proper name for such a power hungry man with wrong motives in using and abusing authority is a A SPIRITUAL DICTATOR. That''s exactly what Mr. Lee has turned out to be. He can live in denial all he wants, but we know better. Through his desire &amp; hunger for power he has divided good honest believers, especially from his own country, and many have suffered under his authority even to death. THIS MAN WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BEFORE GOD ALMIGHTY. Where is his fear of God to continue like this? As for the woman who partnered with him, Sarah Barry, she was a very sweet lady once upon a time, when I knew her. She has allowed the abuse and unBiblical ways of treating those under the leadership in UBF (Chicago) although she was raised in the South with a strong biblical background and worked with the navigators. She too will be held accountable to GOD for not opening her mouth and putting Mr. Lee in his place, though she has every right being an equal partner. Read the Scriptures, open your Bible, It says that those in leadership positions will be judged with strictness because they are to oversee God''s flock, not lord it over them. A Reformed UBF must remove MAN rrom the throne and put JESUS back up on the throne. In conclusion, The Scriptures have been taught in UBF, granted, but not followed. UBF leaders have interpreted the Scriptures their way, and want people to live their way, not GOD''s way. Jesus says he came to set the captives FREE. UBF has put many emotional and physical burdens on people and called it TRAINING. God has ways of training and maturing us through our jobs and relationships and service through natural experiences in life. Mr. Lee and his devoted followers in UBF try to play GOD and train people. The church of JESUS should be a place of refreshment, encouragement, joy, fellowship and growth to support believers living for Christ, not a place of lording it over the flock and placing heavy loads on the flock. Jesus said WOE to the Pharisees who placed heavy burdens on the flock. To those of you who feel stuck, you''re not. There is life outside of this UBF. <br /><br />God does not want you living in BONDAGE. He comes to set you FREE. There are many good churches in our country. I have been attending one for 7 years now and have served there, I have good quality friendships, and the Lord has taught me so much. Be bold. Move On. Do not be afraid. Ask God for strength. You''re not stuck. You''re not bound. I have NO bitterness about UBF. I thank God for what I have learned there. I was grounded in his word. When I council people who have come out of there, I encourage them to move on and take the positive and let God heal them of the bitterness. Of course, not all stories are the same; some are more painful then others. But I write this to make a statement, that God will judge those who MISUSE his authority. If I were Mr. Lee, I would be trembling before God. But does he even fear God? Dictatorship knows no GOD but SELF. <br /><br />', '一名前成员（最有可能来自芝加哥UBF）', '2001 年3月26日 16:59:26', 'http://exubf.blogspot.com/ex-member-mostly-likely-former-chicago', 1, 2, 1, '2011-08-11 13:18:00'),

At first glance, whether your acquaintance began with their website or in person (e.g. perhaps you were “fished” on campus? Or invited to a Bible conference?), UBF appears to be an evangelical organization. But looks can be deceiving. At best (if, for instance, your shepherd or shepherdess is a true Christian seeking to help you) you’re in for some guilt-trips over your poor performance. “How many times have you fished today?” “How many Bible studies are you doing?” “Don’t you want to live in common life?” And so on. Or worse, you’ll possibly end up in a long-term, co-dependent affair with a jealous lover who’ll never leave you alone. Things could even get worse than this, but I’ll save that for another time. Flee from UBF and embrace Christ! <br /><br />', 'Patrick C.', '2011', 'http://fewfja.com', 1, 1, 2, '2011-08-17 20:48:37');

(3, 1, 3, 'Some years already have passed after I came to Chicago as a student lay missionary. But now, I am asking God for my future guidance, leaving UBF inevitably with a painful heart and deep agony where I devoted my youth and time. In fact, I tried to postpone writing this kind of report. Considering my immature inner being in my staying in UBF, I thought it was the most urgent thing for me to have the personal relationship with God newly and to grow spiritually, instead of doing something right now. However I am writing like this due to my conscience of faith that I should let them know the facts before too late, while I am reading the articles of the web site ubfnet.com. I pray I may not be emotional and write only the facts truthfully in the sight of God. Frankly speaking, I did not have any personal conflict with M. Samuel Lee. When I first came to Chicago UBF, I regarded him so highly and even had a fear to some degree. Yet, from the time I can not exactly remember particularly, I started to listen to the Christian radio and cassette tapes, especially after I finished my school study and went to work in a company in order to solve my visa problem. Then I developed the insight to see Chicago UBF objectively. There are lots of things about which I can speak out. But right now, I want to share with you just two big events which made me leave Chicago UBF. If the opportunities are given, I will share with you more details. \r\n', '', 1),
(4, 1, 4, 'First, the suicide of a young man. I believe that you also know this case to some extent. But I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears how Chicago UBF (M. Samuel Lee) dealt with this case. I am telling you once again, I will witness what I saw with my eyes and heard with my ears. The judgment is all up to you. When Samuel Choi came to Chicago, I met him several times because of computer related business. That''s because I served the computer-related things in those days in Chicago UBF. At that time, he seemed to be a still young, naive and good student. M. Samuel Lee put him in the fellowship of M. Joshua Hong which had the most fruitful student work in those days. M. Joshua Hong is a very faithful servant of God who had the enthusiasm toward God. Actually, the story I heard later is like this: M. Joseph King was the sheep of S. Yoonsook Choi, and he helped Samuel Choi in Korea. Since M. Joseph King knew Samuel Choi well, he wanted to live with him and help him. But under the atmosphere of Chicago UBF, it was impossible to bring out this kind of matter. Once M. Samuel Lee gives the direction, there is no other way except obeying him, even though his direction is unreasonable. Even now I can remember vividly that later on M. Joseph King lamented over how he could not help Samuel Choi and eventually he committed a suicide. \r\n', '首先我要讲的是一名年轻人自杀的事件。我相信，在一定程度上你也听说过这起案件。不同的是，我是亲眼所见、亲耳所闻地经历了芝加哥UBF（撒母耳•李）是如何处理这起事件的全部过程。让我再跟你重复一遍，我将见证的是我亲眼所见、亲耳所闻的事，信不信取决于你自己。当撒母耳•崔前来芝加哥时，我曾因一些计算机相关的事和他有过几面之缘。这是因为那段时间里我负责芝加哥UBF里有关计算机的工作。当时，他看上去依然是个年纪轻轻、天真烂漫的优等生。撒母耳•李把他分配在乔舒亚•洪的团契里面，当时这个团契的学生工作是做得最有成效的一个。乔舒亚•洪是一位非常忠实的神的仆人，对神充满热情。实际上，我后来听说的故事是这样的：约瑟夫•金在韩国曾协助过撒母耳•崔，他是崔允淑的羊羔。由于约瑟夫•金对撒母耳•崔相当了解，因此想要与他同住，以便继续帮助他。然而，在芝加哥UBF的氛围底下，这种事是不可能说出来的。只要撒母耳•李作出了指示，即使不合理，也只得乖乖服从，没有任何回旋余地。即使到了今天，我依然能够清楚记得约瑟夫•金是如何悔恨自己没有能给撒母耳•崔帮上忙，令他最终选择了自杀的情景。', 1),
(5, 1, 5, 'As I recall, Samuel Choi attended a language course first. Then he enrolled in the University of Illinois (at Chicago). But, as I also have the similar experience, it was not easy for the Korean student who did not have the good English skill to catch up the academic course of university in USA. It seems that Samuel Choi was frustrated by himself, struggling desperately. M. Joshua Hong tried to help him to overcome by faith, but Samuel Choi already could not handle it. He dropped all his courses. I don''t know whether it was the direction of M. Samuel Lee or his own personal direction, but he transferred to Loyola University. But he could not carry out his studies well even there. He wanted to go back to Korea. I remember M. Joshua Hong telling me that it was the first time he had seen such a weak person. It is what I heard from M. Joseph King that he already had tried to commit suicide once in Korea, and his mother had asked him to return to Korea without committing a suicide in his difficulties. Eventually, M. Joshua Hong also judged it better to send him back to Korea. He visited M. Samuel Lee and suggested about that matter. In my knowledge, another missionary also visited M. Samuel Lee and gave the same proposal. But M. Samuel Lee had his passport taken away, ignoring their advice. And he gave training to Samuel Choi. He put him in charge of sweeping the countless fallen leaves around the center everyday. I also saw Samuel Choi''s lonely appearance, sweeping the fallen leaves in the late afternoon, when I came from work. In those days, M. Joshua Hong was in Korea because of the marriage of his sister with his American sheep. Later, I heard from one missionary like this: she saw Samuel Choi just two days before his suicide. At that time, he had no focus in his eyes, mumbling, "Somebody stole my document (passport)!" \r\n', '记忆中，撒母耳•崔先是参加了一个语言培训班，随后进入了伊利诺伊州大学（位于芝加哥）念书。不幸的是，正如我的经历一样，在美国大学里念书，对于英语本来就很差劲的韩国学生来说，要赶上学科的进度并不是件容易的事。撒母耳•崔拼命地挣扎着，像是深受了打击。乔舒亚•洪想帮助他依靠信仰来得胜，但是撒母耳•崔早已无能为力。他退修了全部的课程。后来，我不晓得是撒母耳•李，还是他自己个人的意思，他转学去了罗耀拉大学[1]。可即便转去了那里，他仍无法很好地应付学业。他渴望回到韩国。我记得乔舒亚•洪对我说过，这还是他第一次见到如此软弱的人。我从约瑟夫•金那儿听说，此前他在韩国已经有过一次自杀的尝试，于是他的母亲叫他返回韩国，免得因为遇到挫折就轻易放弃生命。最后，连乔舒亚•洪也觉得最好的办法就是把他派回韩国为妙。于是，他向撒母耳•李提了建议。就我所知，还有一位宣教士也找过撒母耳•李，给了同样的建议。但是，撒母耳•李却毫不理会，甚至还把崔的护照藏了起来。他还派撒母耳•崔每天打扫center周围那无数的落叶，用这种方式对他进行训练。一天，我下班回家的路上，见到了撒母耳•崔在黄昏时分扫落叶的孤独身影。那些日子里，乔舒亚•洪正在韩国参加他妹妹与他的美国羊羔两人的婚礼。后来，我从一名宣教士口中听说了这样的事：就在撒母耳•崔自杀前两天，她见到过崔。那时，他脸色暗淡，嘴里喃喃着：“有人偷走了我的文件（护照）！”', 1),

(7, 1, 7, 'It was a Saturday afternoon. I went to the Chicago center to study the 1:1 Bible study with my sheep. His name is Joseph Cruz, and he was living a common life with Samuel Choi in those days. When he came, I could read something serious from his face. I asked, "How are you"? He answered that he was not so fine. Then he told me that Samuel Choi committed suicide through throwing himself down from a high building. At first, I could not believe his words. But he repeatedly told me that that Saturday afternoon, a policeman came and informed him of Samuel Choi''s suicide. And that policeman said that he had already tried to commit suicide earlier in that week, but they just sent him back since he did not tell them his address. So, I informed this news to S. Mark Yang who was staying in Chicago at that time. But S. Mark told me not to tell anybody (even to his parents), and let me wait until M. Samuel Lee gave the direction. I felt we needed the emergency prayer meeting in Chicago UBF. Yet, at that day, Chicago UBF was very quiet. I expected there would be some announcement on the next day, the Lord''s day. However, almost all missionaries were very busy to bring their sheep to the Sunday worship service. What was worse, M. Samuel Lee did not mention anything about that event even during the announcement of Sunday worship service. It was just after the Sunday worship service. By accident, I overheard the telephone dialogue of Dr. Joseph Chung (his son married the older sister of Samuel Choi), when I was passing through. He was asking the quick (the next day) cremation of the remains through the telephone. He said it was not necessary to have the funeral service. M. Paul Chung took hold of me when I was passing by, and let me bring young missionaries to Samuel Choi''s apartment and throw away all his belongings. I was struck dumb to see all these things were progressed so quickly. I had a question that the life of one young man and everything that belonged to him could be disappeared like this in futility, and at the same time I came to be filled with anger. But I did not have the choice except obeying that direction. In that week, there was a regular Tuesday testimony sharing meeting for the assistant fellowship leaders. Almost over twenty people were gathered. But almost everybody did not mention anything about Samuel Choi. Only one or two people with me, mentioned about that. S. Ron Ward, who was the leader of that meeting, did not mention it thoroughly either. Even he did not give any prayer topic for his parents and him. Chicago UBF was never shaken at all. I never saw somebody shed his tears because of that matter. I could not but doubt whether or not this was a Christian fellowship. I couldn''t help asking why we needed to keep on bringing sheep, while we could not serve even a single soul with God''s love. I can not remember exactly whether or not it was that week or the next week, but eventually M. Samuel Lee mentioned about Samuel Choi in the announcement time of Friday meeting. But he expressed no compassion toward him or sympathy toward his parents. M. Samuel Lee blamed his rich parents for raising him up to be so weak. That was all. And the suicide case of Samuel Choi came to be forgotten in Chicago UBF. \r\n', '一个周六下午，我去芝加哥center和我的羊羔一起进行1对1的圣经学习。他的名字叫约瑟夫•克鲁兹，那时，他和撒母耳•崔住在一块儿。他来的时候，我能注意到他的脸上流露出严肃的神情。我问道：“最近好吗？”他回答说不太好。接着他告诉我撒母耳•崔跳楼自杀了。刚开始，我无法相信他所说的。但是他重复了一遍，那个周六的下午，一名警官过来告诉了他撒母耳•崔自杀的消息。这名警官还说，那周的早些时候他也尝试过自杀，但由于他没有告诉他们他的住址，于是他们只好差他回去。于是，我把这则消息告诉了当时待在芝加哥的马克•扬。马克叫我别去告诉任何人（甚至他的父母），让我等候撒母耳•李作出指示。我觉得有必要在芝加哥UBF召开一次紧急的祷告会。可是，那一天芝加哥UBF却非常得安静。我期盼在接下来的主日那天，会发布一些公告。然而，几乎所有的宣教士都只是忙碌着带领自己的羊羔来参加主日礼拜。更糟的是，即使在主日礼拜的公告时间中，撒母耳•李也一点都没有提及到那起事件。主日礼拜刚刚结束之后，当我从约瑟夫•钟（他的儿子娶了撒母耳•崔的姐姐）边上经过时，不经意地听见他在电话里的谈话。他正在电话里要求把遗体尽快（第二天）火化掉，还说没必要举办一场丧礼。保罗•钟在我经过时叫住了我，让我带一批年轻的宣教士到撒母耳•崔的公寓，把他的东西统统扔掉。看着这些事情进展地如此迅速，我一下子震惊地说不出话来。我心里纳闷，怎么一个年轻的生命以及他所拥有的一切居然可以这样得转眼即逝，同时，我也满腔怒火。但我只能服从指示，没得选择。那一周，按例举办了一场助理团契领导人要参加的周二见证分享会，约有二十多人参加了。可是除了仅有的一或两个和我一起的人之外，几乎没有人提起了撒母耳•崔。那次聚会的带领人罗恩•沃德也一点儿没有提到那事，甚至都没有为他和他的父母提出任何代祷的主题。芝加哥UBF没有受到一丝打击，我从未见过哪个人为了那事流过眼泪。我忍不住怀疑这是否真的还是一个基督教团契，我不禁扪心自问，既然我们没有能力用神的爱哪怕帮助一个灵魂，为什么还要把羊羔不停地带进团契当中。我无法确切地记得究竟是在那一周还是在那之后的一周，总之撒母耳•李还是在周五聚会（meeting）的公告时间（announcement time）提到了撒母耳•崔。但是他没有表示对他和他父母的同情或歉意。除了责备了他有钱的父母竟把他抚养成一个如此软弱的人之外，撒母耳•李别的什么都没提。芝加哥UBF里，撒母耳•崔的自杀一案，此后便渐渐被人淡忘。', 1),

(9, 1, 9, 'I don''t know whether you know it or not, but M. Jackie Lee served M. Samuel Lee as a secretary until recently, some years ago, from the pioneering stages of Chicago UBF. Her husband, M. Jacob Lee, died of hypertension some years ago. Some years ago, M. Samuel Lee let her quit the job of the secretary, and publicly blamed her that she did not learn Jesus at all even though she had the privilege to be near him. I know M. Jackie had a very difficult time because suddenly she lost her job and her husband also died. Later on, I had an opportunity to talk with her. At that time, M. Jackie confessed that it was very difficult for her to endure because of the thirst for God''s Word. She said she could not be satisfied any more through God''s Word in UBF. So M. Jackie started to have the Bible study with a wife of the pastor of a church. Then she decided to leave UBF to which she gave all her life. In those days, M. Jackie was staying in Korea. And M. Samuel Lee became aware of the signs of her leaving UBF. M. Jackie has five daughters and a son. Three daughters are already married in UBF. I could see this case from the first, since her daughters were in the same fellowship with me. Suddenly, M. Samuel Lee let the family of her eldest daughter and son-in-law who were living in the house of M. Jackie Lee to move into the house near the UIC Bible House. And he let the fourth daughter of M. Jackie Lee, who was not married yet, move into the same house, too. But the youngest daughter and the youngest son went to Korea with their mother. M. Samuel Lee hurriedly sent the fourth daughter of M. Jackie Lee (about 19 years old at that time) to Korea and let her immediately submit the paper of the marriage with a Korean shepherd (I heard that he was about 6-7 years older than her). \r\n', '不知你了解与否，自从芝加哥UBF的初创时期起，直到最近几年前，杰基•李一直都担任撒母耳•李的秘书。她的丈夫雅各•李几年之前死于高血压。几年以前，撒母耳•李免去了她秘书的工作，且当众责备她虽然有接近他的特权，却一点儿没有学习到耶稣的榜样。我清楚杰基有过一段很艰苦的日子，突然之间，她既丢了工作，又失去了丈夫。后来，我得到了一个机会和她谈话。那天，杰基坦言，对神的话语的渴慕使她很难再忍受下去，UBF里讲的神的话语再也不能使她感到满足。于是杰基开始与一间教堂的牧师的妻子一起学习圣经，随后她下了决心，要离开曾投入了全部生命的UBF。那些日子里，杰基住在韩国，撒母耳•李也察觉到她要离开UBF的迹象。杰基有五个女儿和一个儿子，其中三个女儿已经在UBF里嫁了人。她的女儿和我在一个团契里面，因此我得以从头了解到整个事件的全部过程。先是撒母耳•李突然让当时正住在杰基•李家中的她最年长的女儿和女婿搬进UIC Bible House旁边居住，然后他让杰基•李还未嫁人的四女儿也搬去那里。但是最小的女儿和最小的儿子则跑去了韩国她们母亲那里。撒母耳•李匆忙派杰基•李的四女儿（当时年仅19岁左右）前去韩国，要求她立即提交和一名韩国牧者（我听说他要比她年长6-7岁左右）的结婚申请书。', 14),
(10, 1, 10, 'When M. Jackie came back to Chicago, she had a lot of conflicts with her daughters and sons-in-law. Later I heard from the youngest daughter (a high school student) that M. Samuel Lee visited M. Jackie. At that time, he said to her that she was not qualified to go to her father''s tomb. She was dumbfounded and asked him back why she could not visit. Then M. Samuel Lee said that she defiled the name of her father. And he said that since she left UBF, she became proud and turned against the servant of God. And he cursed her. Because of this, that youngest daughter was immeasurably hurt. One day, M. Jackie received a call from the four married daughters. They started to talk to their mom one by one. They said to her not to call them and not to visit them. According to the youngest daughter, it seemed that somebody (according to her, M. Samuel Lee) let them copy his words from the back. The sons-in-law also called M. Jackie Lee and declared not to meet her. And one of them even called his mother-in-law Satan. M. Jackie went to Korea again. Even though she did not want that marriage, she tried to meet her fourth son-in-law and his parents, since she was in Korea. But M. Samuel Lee (according to M. Jackie Lee) already called them and gave the direction not to meet her, saying that she was involved in the organization of Sun-Myung Moon. The fourth son-in-law did not try to meet her and treated her like an enemy. But his parents persuaded him not to treat his mother-in-law worse than the worldly people, so that they could meet each other. But it was still hostile. \r\n', '当杰基回到芝加哥后，她与其女儿和女婿有过许多争执。后来我从她年纪最小的女儿（一位高中生）那里打听到撒母耳•李曾去找过杰基，对她说，她没有资格瞻仰他父亲的坟墓。她顿时哑然，问他为什么不能瞻仰父亲的坟墓。撒母耳•李解释说，是因为她羞辱了她父亲的名声。他还说，自从她离开了UBF，就变得骄傲起来，而且转而攻击神的仆人。他还诅咒她。正因如此，她最小的女儿受到了巨大的创伤。一天，杰基接到了来自那四个已婚女儿的来电，她们一个接一个地和她们的妈妈交谈。她们让她别去看望她们，也别给她们打电话。据那位最小的女儿猜测，好像是某人（她认为是撒母耳•李）一面在背后作指示，一面让她们在电话里复述他的话。连她的女婿也给杰基•李打了电话，声称不会与她见面，其中一名女婿甚至称呼他的岳母为撒旦。杰基又动身去了趟韩国。到了韩国，尽管她对他们的婚姻并不感到满意，她还是尝试去见那位娶了她四女儿的女婿及他们的家长。然而撒母耳•李（据杰基•李 的说法）早已给他们打了电话，说她加入了文鲜明（译注：统一教教主）的组织，指示他们不要见她。于是娶了四女儿的那名女婿没有去见她，还待她好像敌人一般。但是他的父母后来说服了他，让他待岳母的态度好一点，别比待世俗的人还差，这样彼此还能够见面，虽然如此，他们还是对她充满着敌意。', 1),

Among them, there was the wedding ceremony of the fourth daughter of M. Jackie Lee. But that daughter called to M. Jackie Lee and told her not to come. But M. Jackie attended the wedding ceremony after a long prayer. Maybe, you can guess how much hostile they are, once you left UBF. It was an enormous decision for M. Jackie to attend the wedding ceremony of her daughter. The wedding ceremonies of those ten couples were the marriages between the daughters of the missionaries who were just over twenty and Korean young missionaries. I already left UBF at that time. But I heard that they finished a wedding ceremony in fifteen minutes. I heard that M. Samuel Lee called M. Jackie Lee and demanded that she offer at least $20,000, since he blessed her daughter''s marriage. \r\n', '最终，在撒母耳•李生日那一周的周五，举办了十对夫妇的结婚典礼，杰基•李的四女儿的婚礼就在其中。可是那位女儿却打电话给杰基•李让她不要参加。杰基在经过漫长的祷告后硬是参加了这场结婚仪式。你也许能猜想得出，一旦你离开了UBF，他们会对你有多大的敌意。因此杰基决心参加女儿的结婚典礼，这对她来说是一个艰难的决定。这十对参加婚礼的新人当中，新娘们都是20刚出头的传教士们的女儿，新郎们则都是年轻的韩国传教士。那时，我虽然已经离开了UBF，还是听说到他们在短短15分钟内就结束了整场婚礼的消息。据说撒母耳•李打电话给杰基•李，说因为他给她女儿的婚姻作了祝福，因此她得至少奉献20,000美金。', 1),

(18, 2, 4, 'UBF was a place were I came to know Christ through the wonderful one to one Bible study, with a buddy I went to high school with. I really loved the study of Genesis and the Study of John''s Gospel. I made a decision to go to College and serve as a bible teacher to the students. God blessed my life in college and after the summer retreat and making a decision to go to school, a full tuition was in the mail. I was so focused on GOD & JESUS not on man that he protected me and blessed my ministry. I was outspoken during the meetings and believe that created some jealousy even with leaders, but I was walking with Christ and happy. My first 7 years in UBF were blessed years, years of growth and fellowship. I stayed in this ministry for 13 years total; the last 6 were hard and dry due to the fact that I did not follow the beat of the leader''s drum after graduation. It was the only time I had to deal with the leader and the unthoughtful words and actions that came out of his mouth. But like I said before...God Protected me from the garbage and helped me to stay focused on Him. I felt that I was stuck in this place until I started attending another church. I realize how small a view of Christianity I had in UBF. God is SO, SO much bigger and better. Unfortunately, any organization that puts others down, and says they''re the only one and the only way, and if you leave you''re doomed...this is a danger sign and a sign of a cult. UBF began at the Clark Street Center as a nice humble place. There were so many good people with giving hearts in this ministry that wanted to serve God. I have heard many heartbreaking stories of lives crushed by the words and actions of Mr. Lee and his followers. God used me to encourage them to move on. There is Life after UBF. And God will use what we learned there. I dare not call Mr. Lee a Reverend, Pastor or Shepherd. The proper name for such a power hungry man with wrong motives in using and abusing authority is a A SPIRITUAL DICTATOR. That''s exactly what Mr. Lee has turned out to be. He can live in denial all he wants, but we know better. Through his desire & hunger for power he has divided good honest believers, especially from his own country, and many have suffered under his authority even to death. THIS MAN WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BEFORE GOD ALMIGHTY. Where is his fear of God to continue like this? As for the woman who partnered with him, Sarah Barry, she was a very sweet lady once upon a time, when I knew her. She has allowed the abuse and unBiblical ways of treating those under the leadership in UBF (Chicago) although she was raised in the South with a strong biblical background and worked with the navigators. She too will be held accountable to GOD for not opening her mouth and putting Mr. Lee in his place, though she has every right being an equal partner. Read the Scriptures, open your Bible, It says that those in leadership positions will be judged with strictness because they are to oversee God''s flock, not lord it over them. A Reformed UBF must remove MAN rrom the throne and put JESUS back up on the throne. In conclusion, The Scriptures have been taught in UBF, granted, but not followed. UBF leaders have interpreted the Scriptures their way, and want people to live their way, not GOD''s way. Jesus says he came to set the captives FREE. UBF has put many emotional and physical burdens on people and called it TRAINING. God has ways of training and maturing us through our jobs and relationships and service through natural experiences in life. Mr. Lee and his devoted followers in UBF try to play GOD and train people. The church of JESUS should be a place of refreshment, encouragement, joy, fellowship and growth to support believers living for Christ, not a place of lording it over the flock and placing heavy loads on the flock. Jesus said WOE to the Pharisees who placed heavy burdens on the flock. To those of you who feel stuck, you''re not. There is life outside of this UBF. \r\n', '我通过UBF的1对1圣经学习开始认识了基督。我是跟我的高中伙伴一起去参加的学习。我非常喜欢创世记和约翰福音的学习。而后我决定上大学，然后做一位圣经教师。上帝祝福了我的大学生涯。在参加了夏季退修会后，我决定去上学，邮箱里就有全额的奖学金。我定意仰望上帝和耶稣而不是仰望人，因而上帝就保护我，祝福我的事工。在聚会中我曾直言不讳，相信这已经引起了领导人的嫉妒，但我仍与基督快乐同行。我在UBF的头7年是受到祝福、成长和跟伙伴们情同手足的7年。我总共在这个教会里呆了13年，由于我毕业后没有跟随领导人的步伐，这后来的6年却是在艰涩中度过。仅仅这段时间，才是我不得不忍受领导人和他嘴巴里吐出的那些不加思考的话与行为的时间。但就像我之前说的，上帝在这些不堪的事上保护我，让我只定睛在他身上。我感到我被困在了这个地方，直到我开始进入了另一个教会。我意识到我在UBF里对于基督教的理解太过狭隘了，而神是如此如此地广大与美好。不幸的是，任何一个贬低别人的组织，说唯有自己正确，是惟一的道路，如果你离开这个组织，就在劫难逃……这是危险的信号，邪教的信号。UBF始于Clark街中心，开始是一个很好很谦卑的教会，有很多很好的成员，在教会里怀着奉献心肠，想事奉上帝。我听说了许多让人心碎的生命故事，都是由Mr. Lee和其追随者的言语和行为施压产生的结果。上帝使用我来鼓励他们往前走。这是离开UBF后的事了。上帝还将继续使用我们在那里学到的东西。我不敢把Mr. Lee称作一名教士（Reverend）、牧师（Pastor）或牧者（Shepherd）。对于这样一个重权欲，且以错误的动机滥用权威的人，应该确切的称呼他为一名属灵独裁者。这恰恰就是Mr. Lee的样子。对他的欲望，他可以矢口否认，但我们知道的更清楚。因他对权力的欲望和饥渴，他剪除了诚实善良的信徒，特别是从他自己国家来的那些，还有许多受他权威之压乃至至死的人。这个人在神的权能的审判前要对自己的行为负责。他对上帝的敬畏究竟在哪里，让他可以继续无视上帝的权柄？这里就要提到Sarah Barry。她是Mr. Lee的伙伴，想当年我认识她时，她真是一个甜妹子。尽管是在南方长大，受过严格的圣经教育，还和教会带领人（navigators）一起工作，她却允许使用虐待（abuse）和不合圣经（unbiblical）的方式对待那些在UBF（芝加哥）领导层底下的肢体们。她没有开口规正Mr. Lee，尽管做为一个平等的伙伴（partner）有权这么做；为此她也应该在神面前负责。打开圣经，读一下经文，圣经中说：那些处在领导位置的人会被严格地审核，因为他们监管着神的群羊，而不是在他们面前逞威风。[1]改革过的UBF（Reformed UBF）必须把人从首位挪开，让基督坐回宝座上。总之，在UBF这段经文已经被教导了，认可了，却不得实行。UBF的领袖们用自己的方式诠释圣经，也巴望着人们也用他们的方式，不是上帝的方式生活。耶稣说，他来是叫为奴的得自由。UBF却把精神和肉体上的重担压在人身上，曰其名为训练。上帝用透过我们日常生活中的工作和关系以及服侍的方式来训练我们，让我们成熟。而Mr. Lee和他UBF里忠心的追随者们却试着扮演上帝，训练信徒。基督的教会应该是一个充满更新、鼓励、喜乐、团契相交、生命成长，让信徒为基督而活的地方，而不是一个辖制信众，把重担放在信众身上的地方。耶稣说：你们法利赛人也有祸了。因为你们把难担的担子，放在人身上。那些进退维谷的信徒们，其实你们可以有改变。在UBF之外还有生活。', 15),
(19, 2, 5, 'God does not want you living in BONDAGE. He comes to set you FREE. There are many good churches in our country. I have been attending one for 7 years now and have served there, I have good quality friendships, and the Lord has taught me so much. Be bold. Move On. Do not be afraid. Ask God for strength. You''re not stuck. You''re not bound. I have NO bitterness about UBF. I thank God for what I have learned there. I was grounded in his word. When I council people who have come out of there, I encourage them to move on and take the positive and let God heal them of the bitterness. Of course, not all stories are the same; some are more painful then others. But I write this to make a statement, that God will judge those who MISUSE his authority. If I were Mr. Lee, I would be trembling before God. But does he even fear God? Dictatorship knows no GOD but SELF.

I am currently going to a church called UBF (University Bible Fellowship). many koreans whom I have met recently seem to think that UBF isn''t a real church, but just a Christian organization where people are trained to become missionaries. I guess I never thought about that aspect of UBF, but it is true that UBF people are trained to become good bible teachers/shepherds, and also to become missionaries who work for God in foreign countries. UBF is also a church to me, because I go there every Sunday to worship God.\r\n', '过去，我去过许多不同的教会。我是一个新教徒，但我也不介意去天主教会。最近我去的一家教会叫UBF。我最近遇到许多韩国人似乎认为UBF不是一个真正意义上的教会，而是一个基督教组织，信徒在那里得到训练而成为传教士。我想我从未想过UBF的这一方面，但UBF的肢体们确实训练成了优秀的圣经教师/牧者，而且也成为传教士为上帝在国外工作。UBF对我来说也是一家教会，因为我每周日都去那里敬拜上帝。', 1),
(22, 3, 3, 'I feel that there is a strong traiditionism in UBF. Not in every UBF, but in some UBFs many traditions are emphasized like writing and sharing testimonies on Fridays, having one-to-one Bible studies, going fishing (which means you go out to campus to ask students to study the Bible or to ask them to come to one of the church meetings/worship services), and if one is musician, which I consider myself to be one, practicing/playing in an orchestra to prepare music for the Sunday worship services and some special events. I think that all these are very good things to do. When they are done in the right spirit before God, they can allow one to grow more spiritually. But when people become so focused on the actual traidtion and not on God problems arise. When people are concerned with the number of their sheep (refer to bible students), the number of the people they invite to the worship services, and etc., they forget the true meaning of worshipping God and obeying His words.\r\n', '我觉得在UBF中有很强的传统性。并非每一家UBF里，但在其中一些，强调不少的传统，如写作，在周五分享见证，一对一圣经学习，授渔（going fishing）（即进入校园邀请学生参加圣经学习或邀请他们去教会聚会/崇拜），如果有人会音乐，我认为自己是的，在乐队为周日崇拜和一些特别的事件准备音乐。我觉得做这些事都是很好的。当他们用正直的灵在上帝面前做的时候，他们会让这人的灵性更加成长。但当肢体关注实际传统而非上帝时，问题就出现了。当他们关注群羊（指学习圣经的学生）的数量，关注他们邀请到有多少人参加敬拜，诸如此类，他们就忘记敬拜上帝的真正含义，忘记遵行神的话语。', 1),
(23, 3, 4, 'I truly admire UBF missionaries/shepherds because many of them work ardously to participate in God''s salvation work. I am glad that I am involved in UBF and to even have some people whom I can study the Bible with. But I see that some times people in UBF are so close-minded, and they do not learn from other Christians.

Some people have never gone to other Christian meetings, like the Navigator and Campus Crusade for Christ, and they only know what it is like to be in UBF.\r\n', '我的确挺赞赏UBF的传教士/牧者，因为他们中许多人努力工作（work ardously）参与到神的救赎工作中。很高兴，我也参加了UBF甚至have一些肢体，能和他们一起学习圣经。但我看到有时UBF中的肢体思想狭隘，不向其它基督徒学习。一些人过于习惯UBF的传统，以至每周忘记为什么不想写见证。其中一些人从未去过其它基督教会，如Navigator航行者和Campus Crusade for Christ校园基督护教会，他们只知道在UBF里是怎么们的情形。', 1),
(24, 3, 5, 'I have never met Dr. Samuel Lee personally. But I do know that he was used by God to establish UBF, and he did a great work in God because UBF has become one of God''s instruments to preach the Gospel. It was through UBF missionaries that I have come to know Christ personally, so I am grateful for UBF. However, when I see people who think of Dr. Samuel Lee as God''s servant whom they should ALWAYS obey (just because he is God''s servant), I wonder whether they are putting God first or a human being first. It''s not that I am against obeying church leaders. Of course, I should obey God''s servants, because that''s the right spirit before God. However, when the servant has done something wrong, when the servant has brought down people''s spiritual lives because of his/her own actions/thoughts/words (which do not come from God, but from the human nature), people should be able to discern whether the servant is really doing what God inteded him/her to do. There must have been a reason why so many people left UBF. And I personally don''t think that those people left UBF just to rebel against God''s servants. But some people think that the people who left UBF were being rebellious to God''s servant, Dr. Samuel Lee, and that they weren''t following God. (I strongly disagree with this kind of opinions.) If people think that objecting to Dr. Lee''s certain behaviours, which did not come from God''s own but from human calculations and expectations, is wrong thing to do, that''s okay with me. But if they are so blinded to the extent that they can''t see ANYTHING wrong in a human being, I think that that''s a problem.\r\n', '我个人从没见过李•smauel博士，但我知道他被上帝使用建立UBF，他过去的确为上帝做了巨大的工作，因为UBF已经成了上帝传福音的器皿之一。正是通过UBF的传教士们，我开始认识了基督，所以我很感激UBF。但是当我看到那些认为李•smauel博士是神的仆人的肢体服在他的权柄之下（仅仅因为他是神的仆人），我就奇怪他们是否把上帝放在第一还是在高举一个人。不是我不遵从教会领袖的命令，当然，我应该遵从神的仆人，因为这是正直的灵。但当神的仆人做了错误的事情，当他（她）的言语、行为及思想（并非从神而来，而是来自人的血气）绊倒人们的灵性生活，大家就应该能察觉出这个神的仆人是否真的在做神想让他（她）做的事。这么多人离开UBF一定早有原因。我个人认为那些离开的人不仅仅是因为反对神的仆人。但有些人觉得那些离开UBF的人是对神仆人—李•Samuel博士的反叛心理，他们根本没有跟随耶稣。（我强烈反对这种观点。）如果认为反对李博士的某些行为是错误的，就是那些不是从神来的，而从人的谋算和期望来的行为，对此我觉得还行。但如果他们如果盲目到一种程度根本看不到人的任何错误，我觉得这就是个问题了。', 1),

Then why do I say all these bad things about UBF? well, I didn''t say bad things about UBF, but I said some things about the people who seem to be close-minded.

(26, 3, 7, 'A friend of mine has told me that UBF is a cult. He/she has been in UBF for a long time, but apparently his/her family were hurt a lot because of UBF. I don''t know the details, but it probably has to do with a UBF''s director, because that''s usually where the problem comes from. When a church leader forgets to fix his/her eyes on Jesus, he/she begins to act like a dictator, thus scarring many people''s heart. My friend was mad at him/her when I was telling him/her that maybe he/she shouldn''t generalize so much and that he/she should let go of the hatred which he/she has toward UBF. But I have to admit that I had no right telling him/her things like that. I have never been in a situation where I was so hurt to the extent that I wanted to leave UBF. My family isn''t in UBF, so I haven''t experienced my whole family being the victim of the "dictatorship." But I see that some people in UBF lack shepherd heart for people around them. Instead of trying to understand, some UBF people tend to make their "sheep" feel guilty by asking them "why can''t you come?" Asking part is okay, but if they do not desire to UNDERSTAND the reason for not coming to worship services or to Friday meetings or to Bible studies, how can the "sheep" actually tell them the reason without feeling guilty?? I actually think that they don''t even have to ask "why" because they do not really need to know the reason. Don''t they believe that God knows why their "sheep" is not coming to the services/bible studies? If they have that faith, they might as well just pray for the "sheep" so that God may move the "sheep"''s hearts to come to the worship services/Bible studies. Trying to know everything about one''s life is sometimes too burndening. I feel like some people in UBF try to dictate one''s life instead of trying to let God control. Having expectations from the "sheep" is okay, but I wish that they didn''t push their own thoughts so much on their "sheep." They might think that certain things are the best for their "sheep," but sometimes what they think of the best isn''t always the best for the "sheep."\r\n', '我的一个朋友告诉我说UBF是邪教，他（她）在UBF已经很久了，但显然他（她）的家庭因UBF而受到许多的伤害。我不了解细节，但似乎是和UBF的一个执事有关，因为这是问题出现的通常症结。教会领袖如果不定睛在耶稣身上，他（她）就会像一个导演，由此伤害许多人的心灵。我这朋友对于他（她）很生气，我就告诉他（她）也许不要这样…..\r\n他（她）应该释放对UBF的仇恨。。。。但我不得不承认说我没有权利对他说这些事。\r\n我从来没有经历过这样的情形，就是被伤害到想到离开UBF。我的家庭不在UBF里，所以我没有经历过整个家庭成了独裁的牺牲品。但我看到UBF的肢体们对于周围的人缺乏牧者的心肠。一些UBF的肢体试图让他们的群羊有负罪感，常常质疑他们“为什么你不能来？”而不是试着去理解他们。询问这事还好，但如果他们不愿了解肢体为什么不能来参加敬拜或周五聚会或是圣经学习，“群羊”怎能告诉他们原因同时又不会觉得有罪？？我的确认为他们甚至不需要问“为什么”，因为他们真的不需要知道其中原因。他们不是相信上帝知道他们的“羊”为何没有参加聚会/圣经学习？如果他们相信，他们也可以只是为“群羊”祷告，这样上帝会感动“群羊”的心来参加敬拜或圣经学习。关心一个人的所有生活内容，是很大的重担。我觉得UBF中的人们想要控制人的生活而不是试着让上帝管理肢体。对“群羊”有期待是对的，但我希望他们不要把自己的想法过多地加在“羊”的身上。他们也许觉得某件事对他们的“羊”是最好的，但有时他们所认为最好的事，不一定对这些“羊”来说是最好的。', 1),
